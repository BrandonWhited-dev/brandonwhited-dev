## Hi, I'm Brandon Whited ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Temple University graduate with a passion for web development. After several years building full stack web applications, I recently transitioned to backend programming with Go.

I am the developer and maintainer of twitchkit. A series of Go libraries that interacts with Twitch's IRC, EventSub, and API.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go
